# True != true bool must be capitolized T and F
# We have to dive a little into comparison operators to show booleans

# Note that > is a comparision operator asking if 1 is greater than 2
print(1>2)
# Here we can return a True by checking if 1 is equal to '==' 1
print(1==1)

# We will cover booleans more in detail when the actauly matter to us, but for now this is the quick overview... It's just True or False
