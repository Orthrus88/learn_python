'''
Control flow with If, Elif, and else

Need to pay close attention to whitespace / indentation and where your :'s are
'''

# If statement
# if some_condition:
    # execute some code
# else:
    # do something else

#notice there are not conditions for else we use elif for that

# if some_condition:
    # do something
# elif some_other_condition:
    # do something else
# else:
    # if none of those just do this

# example
