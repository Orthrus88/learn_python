--------------------------NUMBERS--------------------------

Answer these 3 questions.
    What is the value of the expression 4 * (6 + 5)
    What is the value of the expression 4 * 6 + 5 
    What is the value of the expression 4 + 6 * 5


What is the type of the result of the expression 3 + 1.5 + 4?


What would you use to find a number's square root, as well as its square?


--------------------------STRINGS--------------------------

If s = 'hello' give an index command that returns 'e'. Enter your code in the cell below.


Now reverse the string 'hello' using slicing.


Given the string hello, give two methods of producing the letter 'o' using indexing.


--------------------------LISTS--------------------------

Build this list [0,0,0] two separate ways.


Reassign 'hello' in this nested list to say 'goodbye' instead: list3 = [1,2,[3,4,'hello']]


Sort the list: list4 = [5,3,4,6,1]


--------------------------DICTIONARIES--------------------------
Using keys and indexing, grab the 'hello' from the following dictionaries:

d1 = {'simple_key':'hello'}
d2 = {'k1':{'k2':'hello'}}
d3 = {'k1':[{'nest_key':['this is deep',['hello']]}]}
d4 = {'k1':[1,2,{'k2':['this is tricky',{'tough':[1,2,['hello']]}]}]}
NOTE: if you ever write code like d4 I will hunt you down... murder your family and eat your fucking dog


--------------------------TUPLES--------------------------

What is the major difference between tuples and lists?


How do you create a tuple?


--------------------------SETS--------------------------

What is unique about a set?


Use a set to find the unique values of the list: list5 = [1,2,2,33,4,4,11,22,3,3,2]


--------------------------BOOLEANS--------------------------

==	If the values of two operands are equal, then the condition becomes true.	(a == b) is not true.
!=	If values of two operands are not equal, then condition becomes true.	(a != b) is true.
>	If the value of left operand is greater than the value of right operand, then condition becomes true.	(a > b) is not true.
<	If the value of left operand is less than the value of right operand, then condition becomes true.	(a < b) is true.
>=	If the value of left operand is greater than or equal to the value of right operand, then condition becomes true.	(a >= b) is not true.
<=	If the value of left operand is less than or equal to the value of right operand, then condition becomes true.	(a <= b) is true.

What will be the resulting Boolean of the following pieces of code (answer fist then check by typing it in you fuck wit)

2 > 3
3 <= 2
3 == 2.0
3.0 == 3
4**0.5 != 2

# Lets do something more difficult
# two nested lists
list_one = [1,2,[3,4]]
list_two = [1,2,{'k1':4}]

# True or False?
list_one[2][0] >= list_two[2]['k1']
